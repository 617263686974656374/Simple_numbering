# Simple_numbering
This Java program generates a list of numbers based on user-defined parameters. It prompts the user for three key inputs: the starting number of the list, the ending number, and the increment (next hop) between each number in the list. The program includes validation checks to ensure that all inputs are integers, the ending number is greater than the starting number, and the increment is a positive number. Once valid inputs are provided, it creates and displays a sequence of numbers, starting from the first number, and increasing by the defined increment, up until it reaches or surpasses the end number. This program is particularly useful for generating ordered numerical sequences with custom intervals.
